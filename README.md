# Wishlist Management Platform 🎁🎄✨

This project was developed to create a more efficient and user-friendly wishlist management application for family and friends. 🎉🎈🎊

## Core Features 🎯✅📌

### Self-Hosting Infrastructure 🖥️💻📂
- The application uses React for the frontend and PostgreSQL for data management, though alternative tech stack suggestions are welcome.

### User Account Management 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🔒📋
- Users can register personal accounts.
- Each user can create and manage multiple wishlists.

### Wishlist Item Management 🛒🎁📝
- **Automated URL Scraping:** Extract item details such as name, description, price, and images directly from URLs.
- **Manual Entry:** Users can manually input item details when needed.

### Gift Tracking and Privacy Controls 🎁🔒🎯
- **Purchase Tracking:** Gift-givers can mark items as purchased.
- **Privacy Settings:**
  - Purchased items remain hidden from the wishlist owner until a specified gifting date has passed.
  - Dates are configurable, defaulting to the most recently entered date or auto-setting for recurring events like Christmas.
  - After the event, purchased items are hidden from the active list but remain documented.

### Collaborative Gifting Environment 🧑‍🤝‍🧑💬🤝
- **Private Gift Discussions:**
  - Each wishlist item includes a private discussion thread for gift-givers, hidden from the wishlist owner.
  - This feature allows friends and family to coordinate gift purchases seamlessly.

By incorporating these features, the platform provides a secure, collaborative, and user-focused wishlist management experience, making gift-giving more enjoyable and organized. 🎁❤️🎉
